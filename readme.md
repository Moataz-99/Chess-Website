#Simple fullstack web project for graduation 
this is my first fullstack project i'v ever made i had to learn all if this is 3 months so i could finish the project in 

Main target was to create a web 3 web applicartion so i tried to use the simplest and most updated way in every part in the website.

##Technologies used in the development process 
 *Figma (for designing the ui)
 *EJS (for HTML templates)
 *Bootstrap(used some of Bootstrap classes)
 *Node.js (To build an restfulAPI)
 *ExpressJS (to handle my HTTPS requests)
 *MongoDB(the DataBase)


###Discreption 
The graduation project was about a robot arm that you can control to play against another person in front of it. 

My part in the prject is to build a Chess website that can send a chess notation to the DataBase and then the Arm will read the notation and send it to the Arduino (the controller) which will make the move in chessboard .
